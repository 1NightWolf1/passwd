        	* Modify "update-passwd" script to take more arguments, rather
        	  than read in the ancient passwd format of the extant conf
        	  files, now that we're not catting that into niload.
        	* Put the user/group strings into the user packages.
            * Modify UID/GID allocation
            	* Don't overwrite entries for existing users, since we don't
            	  use the existing static UID/GID numbers for anything anyway.
                * Stop using 250-299 range, which is subject to use by Apple.
                * Dynamic by default
                	* Use information from fink.conf, e.g. to 
                      pick up network-specific settings.
                    * Fall back to 600-699 range otherwise.
                * User override (assuming that fink isn't already set up with
                  a range) via a prompt rather than editing a config file.

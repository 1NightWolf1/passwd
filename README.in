Passwd-core package for the Fink Project
http://www.finkproject.org/

The package passwd-core and its associated splitoffs are in the Public Domain.

This package provides a unified method by which several administrative user
and group entries can be added to your user database by the various "passwd-*"
packages. These are needed to protect the data of several daemons (e.g. news 
server, database server, etc.).

USAGE: 
This package installs the "update-passwd" script, which takes arguments in the 
following format:

@PREFIX@/sbin/update-passwd [<user name> <description> <home directory> <shell>] <group name> <group membership>

In addition, during the install process the package will check whether fink is
using an automatic ID range (the default as of fink-0.33.0) and set itself to 
match, or will query the user whether automatic or manual allocation is 
desired.  This setting is saved in @PREFIX@/etc/passwd.conf.   

UID and GID entries for users can be assigned in several ways:

1)  If there is already a matching user and/or group on the system, it/they
will be regarded as satisfying the requirement of the package that needs them.  
Examples are:  users/groups installed by previous versions of the passwd-* 
packages, or deployed via a central directory service.  No action is needed.

2)  If there is no matching user, then the UID and GID will be either 
generated dynamically or via operator interaction, depending on the 
configuration in @PREFIX@/etc/passwd.conf.

If the user entry is not created, either because the operator elected not to
proceed with a manual install, or if the dynamic allocation range is full,
the passwd-* package will still be installed.

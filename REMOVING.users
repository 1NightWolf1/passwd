Removing users/groups:

Fink doesn't remove package-specific users/groups, since these might have been
deployed on the system by some other method.  If you want to remove them, the
following commands should suffice:

sudo dscl . -delete /Users/<username>
sudo dscl . -delete /Groups/<groupname>

For example:

sudo dscl . -delete /Users/news
sudo dscl . -delete /Groups/news

to remove the "news" user installed by "passwd-news".
